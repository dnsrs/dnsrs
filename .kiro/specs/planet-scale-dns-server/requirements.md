# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a planet-scale DNS server implementation in Rust using Tokio for async operations, FlatBuffers for zero-copy serialization, and an internal database with both disk persistence and RAM caching. The server will support standard DNS operations, zone transfers for clustering, and ad-blocking capabilities similar to Pi-hole.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core DNS Protocol Support

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the DNS server to handle standard DNS queries and responses, so that it can serve as a drop-in replacement for existing DNS infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DNS query is received THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the query according to RFC 1035
2. WHEN a valid A record query is received THEN the system SHALL return the corresponding IPv4 address
3. WHEN a valid AAAA record query is received THEN the system SHALL return the corresponding IPv6 address
4. WHEN a valid MX record query is received THEN the system SHALL return mail exchange records with proper priority ordering
5. WHEN a valid CNAME record query is received THEN the system SHALL return the canonical name
6. WHEN a valid NS record query is received THEN the system SHALL return authoritative name servers
7. WHEN a valid PTR record query is received THEN the system SHALL return reverse DNS lookups
8. WHEN an invalid or malformed query is received THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes
9. WHEN a query for non-existent domain is received THEN the system SHALL return NXDOMAIN response

### Requirement 2: High-Performance Async Operations

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the DNS server to handle thousands of concurrent queries efficiently, so that it can serve high-traffic environments without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL initialize using Tokio async runtime
2. WHEN multiple concurrent queries arrive THEN the system SHALL process them asynchronously without blocking
3. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL utilize zero-copy operations with FlatBuffers for serialization
4. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-millisecond response times for cached queries
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms
6. WHEN CPU usage is high THEN the system SHALL distribute work across available cores

### Requirement 3: Internal Database with Persistence

**User Story:** As a DNS administrator, I want zone data to be stored persistently with fast RAM caching, so that the server can recover from restarts and provide fast query responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN zone data is added THEN the system SHALL persist it to disk storage
2. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL load zone data from disk into RAM cache
3. WHEN a query is received THEN the system SHALL first check RAM cache before disk storage
4. WHEN cache memory is full THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction policy
5. WHEN zone data is modified THEN the system SHALL update both RAM cache and disk storage atomically
6. WHEN disk write fails THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and log errors
7. WHEN cache hit occurs THEN the system SHALL serve response without disk I/O

### Requirement 4: Zone Transfer Support

**User Story:** As a DNS infrastructure manager, I want the server to support zone transfers, so that I can maintain synchronized DNS data across multiple servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured as primary server THEN the system SHALL support AXFR (full zone transfer) requests
2. WHEN configured as secondary server THEN the system SHALL initiate AXFR requests to primary servers
3. WHEN zone data changes THEN the system SHALL support IXFR (incremental zone transfer) for efficiency
4. WHEN zone transfer is requested THEN the system SHALL authenticate the requesting server
5. WHEN zone transfer completes THEN the system SHALL update local zone data and increment serial numbers
6. WHEN zone transfer fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
7. WHEN acting as secondary THEN the system SHALL periodically check for zone updates via SOA queries

### Requirement 5: Clustering and High Availability

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the DNS server to support clustering, so that I can achieve planet-scale availability and load distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple servers are configured THEN the system SHALL support cluster membership discovery
2. WHEN a cluster node fails THEN the system SHALL detect failure and redistribute load
3. WHEN cluster topology changes THEN the system SHALL automatically rebalance query distribution
4. WHEN configured for anycast THEN the system SHALL support geographic load balancing
5. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL report server status to cluster coordinators
6. WHEN split-brain scenarios occur THEN the system SHALL implement consensus mechanisms
7. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL support adding new nodes without service interruption

### Requirement 6: Ad-Blocking Capabilities

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the DNS server to block advertisements and malicious domains, so that I can browse the internet with reduced ads and improved security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blocklist is configured THEN the system SHALL load and cache blocked domain patterns
2. WHEN a query matches blocked domain THEN the system SHALL return NXDOMAIN or redirect to localhost
3. WHEN blocklist is updated THEN the system SHALL reload patterns without service interruption
4. WHEN whitelist is configured THEN the system SHALL allow explicitly permitted domains despite blocklist matches
5. WHEN blocking occurs THEN the system SHALL log blocked queries for monitoring
6. WHEN custom block responses are configured THEN the system SHALL return specified IP addresses
7. WHEN blocklist sources are provided THEN the system SHALL automatically update from remote sources

### Requirement 7: Core API and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive API access to all DNS functions and configuration options, so that I can integrate the DNS server with other systems and automate management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from YAML/TOML files
2. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reload without restart
3. WHEN API is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide REST endpoints for all DNS operations including query, zone management, and statistics
4. WHEN zone data is managed THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for CRUD operations on DNS records
5. WHEN blocklist management is needed THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for adding, removing, and updating blocked domains
6. WHEN cluster operations are required THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for node management and status
7. WHEN metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics via API
8. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL support structured logging with configurable levels
9. WHEN backup is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints to export zone data and configuration
10. WHEN restore is performed THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints to import zone data and validate integrity
11. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support API key and JWT-based authentication
12. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger specification

### Requirement 8: Optional Web Interface Module

**User Story:** As a DNS administrator, I want an optional web-based interface for managing the DNS server, so that I can perform administrative tasks through a user-friendly GUI when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web interface module is enabled THEN the system SHALL serve a web-based management interface
2. WHEN web interface module is disabled THEN the system SHALL operate without any web interface dependencies
3. WHEN web interface is not installed THEN the system SHALL function normally with only API access
4. WHEN web interface is accessed THEN it SHALL provide dashboard views for server status and statistics
5. WHEN zone management is needed THEN the web interface SHALL provide forms for DNS record management
6. WHEN blocklist management is required THEN the web interface SHALL provide tools for managing blocked domains
7. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the web interface SHALL provide forms for server configuration
