# DNSRS: DNS Server

DNSRS is a high-performance, distributed DNS solution built in Rust. It leverages modern async patterns with Tokio, zero-copy serialization with FlatBuffers, and a suite of advanced features to deliver planet-scale performance and security. The architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and compatibility with standard DNS protocols, making it a powerful replacement for traditional DNS infrastructure.

## Features

DNSRS is packed with features designed for performance, scalability, and security.

-   **Core DNS Support**: Full, compliant support for all standard record types (A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, etc.) and a comprehensive implementation of DNSSEC for signing and validation.

-   **Extreme Performance**:
    -   **True Zero-Copy Pipeline**: Uses FlatBuffers and memory-mapped files to process requests without memory allocation or data copying.
    -   **Lock-Free Concurrency**: Employs atomic data structures for massive concurrency without blocking.
    -   **Async I/O**: Built on the Tokio runtime for handling thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
    -   **SIMD Acceleration**: Utilizes SIMD instructions for high-speed pattern matching (blocklists) and hashing.
    -   **Multi-Tier Caching**: Advanced caching system spanning CPU (L1), RAM (L2), and SSD (L3) for lightning-fast responses.

-   **Planet-Scale Clustering**:
    -   **Unlimited Scaling**: A consistent hashing ring architecture allows for unlimited horizontal scaling without consensus overhead.
    -   **Zero-Copy Replication**: Replicates zone data between nodes by transferring raw FlatBuffer bytes directly.
    -   **High Availability**: Automatic failure detection, load rebalancing, and support for anycast deployments.

-   **Advanced Ad-Blocking**:
    -   **Pi-hole Style**: Block advertisements, malware, and other unwanted domains at the DNS level.
    -   **Massive Lists**: High-performance bloom filters and SIMD matching support blocklists with millions of entries.
    -   **Fully Customizable**: Configure custom block responses (e.g., `0.0.0.0`), manage whitelists, and automatically update lists from remote sources.

-   **Robust Security**:
    -   **Modern Protocols**: Encrypt traffic with DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH), and DNS over QUIC (DoQ).
    -   **Advanced DDoS Protection**: Adaptive, machine learning-based rate limiting and query complexity analysis to fend off attacks.
    -   **Threat Intelligence**: Integrates with threat feeds to block malicious domains associated with malware, phishing, and botnets.

-   **Kubernetes Native**:
    -   **DNS Operator**: Includes a Kubernetes Operator for automated deployment, scaling, management, and backups.
    -   **Declarative Configuration**: Use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manage servers, zones, and blocklists natively in Kubernetes.

-   **Management & API**:
    -   **Comprehensive REST API**: A full-featured API provides control over every aspect of the server.
    -   **Hot-Reloading**: Change configuration on-the-fly without service interruption.
    -   **Optional Web UI**: A modular, modern web interface (React/TypeScript) for easy visual management.

-   **Monitoring & Observability**:
    -   **Prometheus Metrics**: Exposes detailed metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.
    -   **Distributed Tracing**: Integrates with OpenTelemetry for end-to-end request tracing.
    -   **Structured Logging**: Detailed, configurable logs for easy debugging and analysis.

## Architecture

The system is designed around a high-performance core engine with distinct layers for protocols, storage, clustering, and monitoring. This modularity allows for exceptional performance and scalability.

Performance Deep Dive

Performance is the cornerstone of DNSRS, achieved through several key strategies:

True Zero-Copy Pipeline: From network to cache to response, DNS packets are handled as raw bytes using FlatBuffers. This avoids expensive serialization, deserialization, and memory allocation, making the entire query path exceptionally fast.

Hash-Only Query Processing: In the hot path, all lookups (blocklist, cache, zone records) are performed using pre-computed 64-bit hashes. This completely avoids string comparisons and deserialization, reducing query processing to a series of highly efficient hash lookups.

Cloud-Native Async Performance: Built entirely on the Tokio async runtime, DNSRS is optimized for modern multi-core processors and containerized environments. It uses a work-stealing scheduler, batch processing, and lock-free data structures to maximize throughput.

Memory Management Optimization: DNSRS uses custom memory allocators (jemalloc), memory pools for common objects, and arena allocation for temporary data to minimize allocation overhead and avoid garbage collection pauses.

Benchmarks show sub-millisecond response times for cached queries and the ability to handle over 1 million queries per second on modern hardware, with performance scaling linearly with available CPU cores.

Security Highlights

Security is a first-class citizen in DNSRS, with a multi-layered defense strategy.

Advanced DDoS Protection: An adaptive rate-limiter uses a token-bucket algorithm to mitigate volumetric attacks. It can analyze query complexity and traffic patterns to identify and block sophisticated application-layer DDoS attacks.

Cryptographic Security: DNSRS enforces TLS 1.3 for all encrypted channels (DoT, DoH, API, cluster communication) and provides a complete DNSSEC implementation for automated zone signing, key rollovers, and validation.

Advanced Threat Detection: The server integrates with threat intelligence feeds to block malicious domains in real-time. It uses machine learning models to detect anomalies, DNS tunneling, and domains generated by DGAs (Domain Generation Algorithms).

Input Validation & Sanitization: A strict DNS packet parser validates all incoming data for RFC compliance, preventing a wide range of attacks related to malformed packets and compression pointers.
